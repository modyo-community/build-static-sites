# Convert a static Site
Learn how to convert an HTML-based site to the Modyo architecture.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, you will need:

- **A code editor.** It can be any of your choice; in the video, we use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

- **A Modyo account.** It is recommended to use your organization's account, but if you don't have access yet, you can use [a trial account](https://platform.modyo.cloud/try).

- **A modern and updated browser.** In this course, we use [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) in its latest version.

- **Internet access.** The Modyo editor works in the cloud, and during the exercise, we use files hosted on external servers. Make sure you have a stable and permanent internet connection. If you use a Proxy/Firewall, verify that you have access to the websites used.
